## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We want to create an application that allows a user to keep track of what books have deeply impacted them and allow them to display those books so others can have recommendations to read as well.  
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->  
1. Import all necessary frameworks and libraries  
2. Set up required variables to access imported frameworks  
3. Build up class constructors from frontend  
4. Grab all objects and packages from necessary databases and convert them into JS objects  
5. Build out render methods to display imported packages  
6. Deploy (frontend: nellify - backend: render)
